        <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind
          texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.</p>

        <p>A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a
          paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.</p>

        <p>Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One

        <p>Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy.</p>

        <p>The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times
          and everything that was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn
          around and return to its own, safe country.</p>

        <p>But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers
          ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her
          for
          their projects again and again.</p>
